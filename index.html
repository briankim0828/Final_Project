      <p>In the late 90s, the widespread commercialization of the internet was seen with wonder and excitement, as some called it “a revolution one can neither resist nor evade”.
        The benefits of this new technology induced great anticipation in the world of information distribution, commerce, entertainment, and even political science and democracy,
        due to its capability in connecting individuals on an unprecedented scale. The possibilities of limitless expression, discussion, and consumption of information were sure
        to develop our world in positive directions.</p>

      <p>However, the revolution did not happen in the way the optimists had expected, as the new medium of communication came with unexpected consequences.
        The internet became a platform of personalization algorithms: lines of code that analyzes individuals on their interests and preferences in a desperate attempt
        to keep the attention fixed in an endless sea of information. Not only does this aggravate political partisanship, but it can also aid in the distribution of
        fake news, fake advertisements, scams, and clickbait headlines that detract from a nuanced viewpoint of any issue.</p>

      The technology that was expected to endorse discussion, became a place of separation, anxiety, and uncertainty.
